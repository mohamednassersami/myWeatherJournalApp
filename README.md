# Weather Journal App

## Project 2 - Weather Journal App (Professional Front-End Web Development Udacity Nanodegree)

#### What I used: HTML, CSS and Javascript

### Project Overview

This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get the temperature based on city's zip code, and dynamically update UI.

### Building

Starter code taken from udacity [repository](https://https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app).

To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. making sure I have Node installed from the terminal. Installed the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from the terminal and them include them in server.js file.
1. Added a GET route that returns the projectData object in my local server code Then, added a POST route that adds incoming data to projectData.
1. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
1. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
1. Created a function that updated UI dynamically.
